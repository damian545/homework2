# homework2 In my home work, is my portfolio. There is a discription about me, a picture of me, sections on what things I have created in my UNI studies, my hobbies and my goals.

Inbedded in my code are column lengths, row lengths and containers. Also a pull down point, for 2 ways on contacting me.
